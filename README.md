# networkDiagnostics
Traceroute, Ping and Speedtest..

This is a fully customizable tool I developed due to my job as an IT Professional. As IT Professionals, we are often required to send network diagnostic reports and this can be strressful sometimes especially when there are other things to attend to. 
With networkDiagx a network Admin can easily run the program while attending to other things and knows that a report will be generated with current date and time. Simple and easy to use. 

KEY FEATURES
100 Pings
Traceroute of a max of 30 hops
Speedtest
Easily Customize destinations (e,g, xxx.xxx.xx.xx, xxx.xxx.xx.xx, xxx.xxx.xx.xx,...)
Easily Customize how many pings you require to each destination specified (packet_count)
For Compilation to Executable (.exe), Do the following 

*Open Command or Terminal
