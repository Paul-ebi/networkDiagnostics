# networkDiagnostics
Traceroute, Ping and Speedtest..

This is a fully customizable tool I developed due to my job as a Systems Admin. I am often required to send network diagnostic reports and this can be strressful sometimes especially when there are other things to attend to. 
With networkDiagx a network Admin can easily run the program while attending to other things and knows that a report will be generated with current date and time. Simple and easy to use. 

Compilation to .exe, Run the following command
*Open Command or Terminal
*Navigate to where the networkDiagx.py is located
*Enter the following command
pyinstaller --onefile networkDiagx.py
